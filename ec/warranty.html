  <h1>EC Model 1 – Terms of Service &amp; Limited Warranty</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Division:</strong> Example Corporation – Legal &amp; Support<br>
    <strong>Appliance:</strong> EC Model 1 Electric Dryer<br>
    <strong>Effective Date:</strong> Date of original purchase or installation
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    This document defines the binding terms between the owner (“User”) and Example Corporation
    (“Manufacturer”) for use, operation, servicing, and warranty coverage of the EC Model 1
    electric dryer. By installing or operating this unit, the User agrees to all terms below.
    This document supersedes all prior representations, verbal or written.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Warranty Scope</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation provides a limited manufacturer’s warranty covering
    <strong>internal manufacturing defects only</strong> for a period of
    <strong>one (1) year from the date of purchase</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coverage applies only if the failure is proven to be internal to the appliance and is
    not related to installation conditions, environment, maintenance failure, or
    external airflow restriction.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples of potentially covered internal failures include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Airflow sensing module failure</li>
    <li>Thermistor malfunction</li>
    <li>High-limit thermostat failure</li>
    <li>Internal wiring defect</li>
    <li>Blower motor failure</li>
    <li>Control board malfunction</li>
    <li>Sensor circuit failures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Coverage is conditional and only applies after all external causes have been
    eliminated through required diagnostic procedures. Unauthorized modification or
    misuse invalidates this warranty.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Exclusions – What Is Not Covered</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Venting issues:</strong> restricted, damaged, crushed, bent, excessive-length, or improperly routed vents.</li>
    <li><strong>Prohibited duct materials:</strong> flexible foil or plastic/vinyl ducts.</li>
    <li><strong>Installation/environment:</strong> incorrect installation, lack of proper grounding, or building design affecting airflow.</li>
    <li><strong>Electrical supply problems:</strong> voltage irregularities or circuit overload.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance failures:</strong> lint filter and moisture sensor neglect.</li>
    <li><strong>Foreign objects or blockage:</strong> debris or items inside the drum or ventilation system.</li>
    <li><strong>Cosmetic damage:</strong> scratches, dents, and normal wear.</li>
    <li><strong>Misuse or neglect:</strong> including operation under unsafe conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-residential use:</strong> commercial, rental, or shared/multi-unit settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Unauthorized repairs:</strong> any non-approved service or parts.</li>
    <li><strong>External events:</strong> acts of nature or structural failure.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Required Venting Standards</h2>

  <p>
    The EC Model 1 requires a low-resistance, unobstructed airflow path for safe operation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Prohibited materials:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexible foil ducting</li>
    <li>Plastic or vinyl ducting</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Permitted materials:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rigid smooth-wall metal ducting</li>
    <li>Semi-rigid metal ducting</li>
    <li>Minimal bends and maximum straight runs</li>
    <li>Unobstructed external exhaust outlet</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the venting system does not meet these standards, the unit may display an
    <strong>CHECK VENTILATION error</strong> (for example, a “Check Ventilation” message, depending on region and configuration). This is normal
    protective operation and does not by itself indicate appliance failure.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Required Diagnostic Test (Internal Test)</h2>

  <p>
    Before any internal defect can be claimed, the following test
    <strong>must be performed and documented</strong> by the User.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Turn the dryer OFF.</li>
    <li>Move the unit 2–3 feet away from the wall.</li>
    <li>Disconnect the exhaust hose from the rear of the dryer.</li>
    <li>Leave the exhaust outlet fully open to the room.</li>
    <li>Run an empty <strong>Manual</strong> cycle for 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the CHECK VENTILATION error <strong>disappears</strong>,
      the cause is considered external. No warranty service will be authorized.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the CHECK VENTILATION error <strong>persists</strong>,
      an internal issue may exist. The User may contact Support for further evaluation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This test is mandatory prior to any service request.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Requirements Before Service Request</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Clean the lint filter completely.</li>
    <li>Clean the moisture sensors with a soft cloth and alcohol.</li>
    <li>Confirm that the external vent hood opens freely and is not obstructed.</li>
    <li>Complete the Duct-Disconnected Gatekeeper Test described in Section 4.</li>
    <li>Ensure the unit is fully accessible and not stacked or blocked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Failure to complete these steps may result in denial of service authorization.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Technician Limitations</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation technicians are authorized to service the appliance only.
    They do not perform work outside the unit itself.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No duct repair or replacement.</li>
    <li>No vent system cleaning.</li>
    <li>No appliance unstacking or relocation.</li>
    <li>No building electrical or structural modification.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Liability Limitation</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation is not liable for incidental or consequential damage, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Property damage</li>
    <li>Damage caused by externally restricted airflow</li>
    <li>Loss of use</li>
    <li>Increased utility costs</li>
    <li>Damage to clothing or contents</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Maximum liability is limited to the original purchase price of the unit.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>

  <p>
    All disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved through binding arbitration
    where permitted by law. Any claim must be initiated within one (1) year of the cause
    arising, or it is barred.
