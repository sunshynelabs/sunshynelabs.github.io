  <h1>EC Model 1 – User Manual &amp; Warranty Overview</h1>
  <p><strong>Appliance:</strong> EC Model 1 Electric Dryer<br>
     <strong>Brand:</strong> Example Corporation</p>

  <hr>

  <hr>

  <h2>I. Manufacturer's Limited Warranty &amp; Service Protocol Disclosure</h2>

  <h3>I.1 Scope of Covered Defects (Internal Manufacturing Faults Only)</h3>
  <p>
    This warranty <strong>covers only manufacturing defects within the dryer unit itself</strong>.
    Coverage is contingent upon the unit being actively <strong>in-warranty</strong>
    (internally categorized as <strong>PRESERVATION_PRIORITY</strong> status, subject to
    valid proof of purchase).
  </p>

  <p><strong>Covered Components include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flow Sense or equivalent airflow safety sensor assemblies</li>
    <li>Thermistors and temperature limit thermostats</li>
    <li>Internal wiring harnesses and control board logic faults</li>
    <li>Blower motor and other internal moving components</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A repair is authorized under this warranty only if the issue is confirmed to be
    an <strong>internal defect</strong> in one or more of these or equivalent components.
  </p>

  <h3>I.2 Explicit Exclusions and Customer Charges (External Issues)</h3>
  <p>
    The warranty <strong>explicitly excludes issues related to installation, usage,
    or external factors</strong>. The systematic diagnostic approach is mandated to
    <strong>"protect you from unnecessary service call charges"</strong> for
    non-covered issues.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Issues NOT Covered by Warranty:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Venting and Airflow Restriction</strong><br>
      Any issue arising from the home's venting system, including but not limited to:
      duct configuration, blockages, excessive duct length, crushed sections,
      or excessive 90-degree bends that create back pressure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Duct Material Violations</strong><br>
      The use of <strong>flexible foil or vinyl ducting</strong> is strictly discouraged
      (known internally as <code>FLEX FOIL</code> or <code>FLEXIBLE_BETRAYAL</code>)
      as its corrugations create airflow turbulence and back pressure, triggering the
      <strong>FlowSense safety code</strong>. Rigid or semi-rigid metal ducting is
      mandatory for optimal airflow compliance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage / Maintenance Neglect</strong><br>
      Issues resulting from failure to clean the lint filter, failure to remove lint
      from the exhaust hood, failure to clean moisture sensors, or misuse of cycles
      not appropriate for the load.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>External Supply Problems</strong><br>
      Problems originating from household electrical supply, breakers, fuses, gas
      supply (for gas models), or building ventilation infrastructure.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Financial Implication:</strong> Because a very high percentage of airflow
    restriction cases are ultimately traced to external venting conditions, any
    service call dispatched <em>before</em> definitive internal isolation will result
    in the customer being charged if the technician confirms the issue is
    non-covered and external.
  </div>

  <h2>II. Mandatory Service Protocol and Gatekeeper Test</h2>

  <p>
    Technician dispatch is strategically set to
    <strong>DEFER_PENDING_VALIDATION</strong> until external causation has been
    conclusively ruled out.
  </p>

  <h3>II.1 The Duct-Disconnected Test ("Hose-Off Test")</h3>
  <p>
    This is the <strong>most crucial diagnostic step</strong> and the mandatory
    <strong>gatekeeper test</strong>, establishing the
    <strong>"semantic inflection point between usage-based and defect-based claims"</strong>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completely remove the vent hose from the back of the dryer.</li>
    <li>Pull the unit 2–3 feet away from the wall for proper clearance and airflow.</li>
    <li>Run an empty <strong>Timed Dry</strong> cycle (for example, 30 minutes on low or medium heat).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the <strong>safety code</strong> (D80 / D90 / D95 or equivalent airflow alert)
      <strong>persists</strong>, this indicates a probable internal manufacturing
      defect and <strong>dispatch may proceed under warranty</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the code <strong>clears</strong> and does not reappear during the hose-off test,
      this strongly confirms an <strong>external venting issue</strong>, and
      <strong>dispatch is denied under warranty</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>II.2 Gas Dryer Prohibition</h3>
  <p>
    Customers with <strong>gas dryers</strong> are explicitly
    <strong>prohibited</strong> from running the duct-disconnected test due to
    safety constraints (open flame and CO risk).
  </p>
  <p>
    In these cases, alternative visual evidence or professional assessments must be
    provided instead (for example, photos of venting, written reports from a
    professional vent cleaning service, or equivalent documentation).
  </p>

  <h3>II.3 Mandatory Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    The professional vent cleaning receipt is <strong>crucial for warranty validation</strong>.
    The <strong>Pre-Service Checklist</strong> also requires confirmation of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completion of at least <strong>5 Timed Dry cycles</strong> (low heat), post-cleaning.</li>
    <li>Thorough cleaning of the <strong>moisture sensors</strong> inside the drum.</li>
    <li>Verification that the exhaust hood opens freely and closes without obstruction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>III. Technician Scope Limitations</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation technicians <strong>perform repairs only</strong> on
    manufacturing defects within the appliance itself.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Technicians are explicitly instructed NOT to handle the following:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Duct replacement, rerouting, or correction of building vent installation.</li>
    <li>
      Unstacking stacked washer/dryer units – the customer must arrange assistance to
      make the unit safely accessible <em>before</em> the visit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Electrical work on the home's supply side, including breakers, outlets,
      or gas shut-off valves.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>IV. Vent Cleaning Reimbursement Policy</h2>

  <p>
    To encourage the proactive maintenance necessary to rule out the overwhelming
    external risk, a conditional reimbursement policy may be offered.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Reimbursement Amount (where applicable):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Up to the local-equivalent of <strong>$100 / £100</strong> for professional vent cleaning services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Eligibility Conditions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The dryer must be <strong>in-warranty</strong> at the time of service.</li>
    <li>The vent cleaning must be performed by a <strong>professional service</strong> with a receipt.</li>
    <li>
      A <strong>manufacturing defect within the unit</strong> must subsequently be confirmed by the
      technician as the root cause <em>after</em> the cleaning was performed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Confirmation of an internal defect is <strong>non-negotiable</strong> for eligibility. If
    the root cause is confirmed to be external, all vent-cleaning costs remain the
    customer's responsibility.
  </p>

  <h2>V. Strategic Re-Framing Mandate (Safety Codes &amp; Messaging)</h2>

  <p>
    All communications regarding FlowSense, D80, D90, or D95 alerts must use the
    terminology <strong>"safety code"</strong> or <strong>"protective feature"</strong>,
    never "error code".
  </p>

  <p>
    This is because the dryer is <strong>performing exactly what it was designed to do</strong>:
    acting as a benevolent <strong>guardian protecting the home</strong> against potential
    fire hazards caused by restricted airflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framing is mandatory for alignment with the overarching goal of
    <strong>TRUST_BUILDING_PROGRESSION</strong> and the ethics of warranty preservation:
    customers must understand that the machine is not "broken"; it is
    <strong>enforcing safety</strong>.
