  <h1>EC Model 1 – Terms of Service &amp; Limited Warranty</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Division:</strong> Example Corporation – Legal &amp; Support<br>
    <strong>Appliance:</strong> EC Model 1 Electric Dryer<br>
    <strong>Effective Date:</strong> Date of original purchase or installation
  </p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    This document defines the binding terms between the owner (“User”) and Example Corporation
    (“Manufacturer”) for use, operation, servicing, and warranty coverage of the EC Model 1
    electric dryer. By installing or operating this unit, the User agrees to all terms below.
    This document supersedes all prior representations, verbal or written.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Warranty Scope</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation provides a limited manufacturer’s warranty covering
    <strong>internal manufacturing defects only</strong> for a period of
    <strong>one (1) year from the date of purchase</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coverage applies only if the failure is proven to be inside the appliance and is
    not related to installation conditions, environment, maintenance failure, or
    external airflow restrictions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Examples of potentially covered internal failures include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Airflow sensing module failure</li>
    <li>Thermistor malfunction</li>
    <li>High-limit thermostat failure</li>
    <li>Internal wiring defect</li>
    <li>Blower motor failure</li>
    <li>Control board malfunction</li>
    <li>Sensor circuit failures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Coverage is conditional and only applies after all external causes have been
    excluded through required diagnostic procedures. Unauthorized modification or
    misuse of the unit voids all warranty coverage.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Exclusions – What Is Not Covered</h2>

  <p>
    The following conditions are not covered under any warranty. Responsibility
    for these remains with the User.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Venting issues:</strong> restricted, damaged, crushed, bent,
      excessive-length, or improperly routed vents of any kind.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prohibited duct materials:</strong> use of flexible foil or
      plastic/vinyl ducts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Installation and environment:</strong> incorrect installation,
      lack of proper electrical grounding, absence of required ventilation,
      or building design issues affecting airflow.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electrical supply problems:</strong> voltage irregularities,
      circuit overload, or other issues originating from the building’s
      electrical system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintenance failures:</strong> not cleaning the lint filter,
      not cleaning moisture sensors, or not ensuring the external vent hood
      can open freely.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Foreign objects or buildup:</strong> coins, nails, debris, or
      other items inside the drum or ventilation system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cosmetic damage after installation:</strong> scratches, dents,
      and normal wear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Damage from misuse, abuse, or neglect:</strong> including water
      exposure or fire caused by external restrictions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Non-residential use:</strong> use in commercial, rental, or
      shared/multi-unit settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unauthorized repair:</strong> work performed by non-authorized
      service providers or with non-approved parts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>External events:</strong> acts of nature, power surges, or
      structural failure.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>3. Required Venting Standards</h2>

  <p>
    The EC Model 1 requires a low-resistance, unobstructed airflow environment
    to operate safely.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Prohibited duct materials:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flexible foil ducting</li>
    <li>Plastic or vinyl accordion ducting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These materials are not permitted due to their tendency to create airflow
    restriction, heat buildup, and fire risk.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Permitted materials:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rigid smooth-wall metal ducting</li>
    <li>Semi-rigid metal ducting</li>
    <li>Vent runs with minimal bends and maximum straight length</li>
    <li>Unobstructed external exhaust point</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the venting system does not meet these standards, the unit may display a
    safety code and restrict operation. This is considered normal protective
    behavior, not a defect.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Required Diagnostic Test (Duct-Disconnected Test)</h2>

  <p>
    Before any internal defect can be claimed, the following test
    <strong>must be performed and documented</strong> by the User.
  </p>

  <h3>Procedure</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Turn the dryer off.</li>
    <li>Pull the unit approximately 2–3 feet from the wall.</li>
    <li>Disconnect the exhaust hose from the back of the dryer.</li>
    <li>Leave the exhaust outlet fully open to the room.</li>
    <li>Run an empty cycle on <strong>Manual / Timed Dry</strong> for 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Interpretation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the safety code <strong>disappears</strong>, the issue is confirmed to be
      external. No warranty service will be authorized. Correction of the venting
      system is the User’s responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the safety code <strong>persists</strong>, an internal failure may exist.
      The User may then contact Support to request further evaluation.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This test is mandatory. If it is not performed, service authorization may be denied.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Requirements Before Service Request</h2>

  <p>
    Before contacting support, the User must complete the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean the lint filter completely.</li>
    <li>Clean the moisture sensors with a soft cloth and alcohol.</li>
    <li>
      Verify that the external vent hood opens freely and is not obstructed
      by debris, nests, or snow.
    </li>
    <li>Complete the Duct-Disconnected Test described in Section 4.</li>
    <li>Ensure the unit is fully accessible and not blocked or stacked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Failure to complete these steps may invalidate a service request.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Technician Limitations</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation technicians are authorized to service the appliance only.
    They do not perform work outside the unit itself.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Technicians do not:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repair or replace ductwork.</li>
    <li>Clean home vent systems.</li>
    <li>Move, unstack, or disassemble stacked appliances.</li>
    <li>Modify or repair building electrical wiring.</li>
    <li>Perform structural or construction work of any kind.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any requirement beyond the appliance connection points is the responsibility
    of the User.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Liability Limitation</h2>

  <p>
    Example Corporation is not responsible for any incidental or consequential
    damages, including but not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Property damage</li>
    <li>Fire damage caused by external airflow restriction</li>
    <li>Loss of use</li>
    <li>Increased utility costs</li>
    <li>Loss or damage to clothing or other contents</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Maximum liability is limited to the original purchase price of the appliance.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>

  <p>
    Any dispute arising from this agreement shall be resolved through binding
    arbitration, where permitted by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    This agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the product
    was purchased. Any claim must be filed within one (1) year of the cause
    arising, or it is barred.
