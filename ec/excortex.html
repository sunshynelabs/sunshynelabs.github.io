            <h4 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 5px;">THE SIMPLEST.</h4>
            <p>ExCortex speaks in the most direct language you already understand: SMS. No login, no account to create, and no new learning curve you need to overcome. If you can read a text message, you can talk to your dryer.</p>
            <p>Receive clear updates about what the machine is doing, what it needs, or if something requires attention.</p>
            <p>No more guesswork. No more technical jargon. Just pure information, delivered to you when it matters most.</p>

        <div style="flex: 1;">
            <h4 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc; padding-bottom: 5px;">MOST RELIABLE.</h4>
            <p>ExCortex is also a local telemetry system that runs entirely inside the dryer—tracking heat, airflow, cycles, and patterns in real time, without Wi-Fi, cloud servers, or external apps. All diagnostic data stays locked inside the unit. There is no upload, no sync, and nothing stored on any external system.</p>
            <p>The system works even during outages, bad signal, or disconnected networks. No app or browser needed.</p>
