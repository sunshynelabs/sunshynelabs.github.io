The machine is monitoring temperature, airflow, and cycle behavior and has decided that air is not moving out of the dryer the way it should. This can be caused by a clogged lint filter, a blocked vent duct, or an installation issue. It is a safety and performance warning."

If the message comes back repeatedly, if the dryer feels unusually hot, or if drying time suddenly increases, stop using the dryer and have the vent system inspected by a qualified vent cleaning professional. Do not keep running repeated cycles with poor airflow."

Third, make sure the exhaust duct is not crushed, kinked, or disconnected behind the dryer. If CHECK VENTILATION still appears after these checks, call a professional vent cleaner to inspect and clear the full duct run. Only contact appliance service once you know the vent path is clear."

Instead of guessing at blinking lights, you receive plain-text guidance such as reminders to clean the filter, warnings about poor airflow, and clear recommendations to contact a vent cleaning professional when necessary. Messages are sent by SMS only; the dryer does not connect to the Internet."

      <h1>CHECK VENTILATION – Support Guide</h1>

      <p>
        This article explains what the <strong>CHECK VENTILATION</strong> message means
        on your <strong>EC Model 1</strong> electric dryer, what you can safely check
        yourself, and when to stop using the machine and call a professional.
      </p>

      <h2>What the message means</h2>
      <p>
        The dryer constantly measures <strong>airflow</strong>, <strong>temperature</strong>,
        and <strong>cycle behavior</strong>. When air can no longer move out of the drum
        as expected, the system raises a <strong>CHECK VENTILATION</strong> alert.
      </p>
      <p>Common causes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lint filter clogged or not seated properly</li>
        <li>Vent outlet on the exterior wall blocked by lint or debris</li>
        <li>Exhaust duct crushed, kinked, or pushed too far behind the dryer</li>
        <li>Long or complex vent runs that have not been cleaned for an extended time</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Poor airflow can increase drying time, waste energy,
        and in severe cases create a fire risk. Treat this message seriously.
      </div>

      <h2>Step 1 – Basic checks you can do yourself</h2>
      <p>Before calling anyone, perform these simple, low-risk checks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean the lint filter.</strong> Remove the filter, clean it completely, and reinstall it correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the outside vent hood.</strong> From outside your home, make sure the vent flap can move freely and is not blocked by lint, dust, or nests.</li>
        <li><strong>Look behind the dryer.</strong> Confirm the exhaust duct is attached, not crushed or sharply bent, and that nothing is pressing the dryer tightly against the wall.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After these checks, run a small test load. If drying time returns to normal
        and the message does not reappear, you can continue normal use.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2 – When to stop and call a vent professional</h2>
      <p>Stop using the dryer and have the vent system professionally inspected if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>CHECK VENTILATION</strong> message returns repeatedly, even after basic cleaning.</li>
        <li>Clothes are still damp after normal cycles.</li>
        <li>The top or sides of the dryer feel unusually hot.</li>
        <li>You notice a burning smell or very hot, humid air around the unit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In these cases, contact a <strong>qualified vent cleaning service</strong>.
        Ask them to inspect and clean the entire duct run from the back of the dryer
        to the outside vent hood.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Do not</strong> continue running back-to-back cycles when airflow is restricted.
        This does not fix the problem and may increase risk. Resolve the vent issue first.
      </div>

      <h2>How ExCortex communicates with you</h2>
      <p>
        Your dryer includes <strong>ExCortex</strong>, an offline AI system that monitors
        its own behavior and can explain what it sees using simple SMS messages.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Messages are sent via <strong>text only</strong> – no app, no Wi-Fi, no cloud.</li>
        <li>ExCortex can remind you to clean the filter or describe what it is noticing.</li>
        <li>For serious airflow problems, it can tell you to <strong>stop using the dryer</strong> and schedule a vent cleaning.</li>
        <li>It cannot browse the web or contact services on your behalf – you choose who to call.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This keeps control in your hands: the machine reports what it sees; you decide
        what to do next.
      </p>

      <h2>When to contact appliance service</h2>
      <p>
        Once you know the vent path is clear and professionally cleaned, contact appliance
        service if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CHECK VENTILATION still appears with a clean, verified vent system, or</li>
        <li>The dryer will not start or stops mid-cycle, even with good airflow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In your service request, mention that <strong>vent cleaning has already been completed</strong>
        so technicians can focus on sensors, controls, or other internal components.
